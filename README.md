# cs347 - Homework 4 

There's Homework4Final.dmd which *should* match. We generated an initial logical model and were able to get a DDL from it, 
however it seems to have corrupted; as in when datamodeler tries to import it, it just fails for no reason. So Homework4Final.dmd 
is a quick logical model, which hopefully is the right one.
